```{r map, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
schools <- data.frame(
        names = c("St. Mary's College of Meycauayan",
                  "Jesus Is Lord Colleges Foundation, Inc.",
                  "University of the Philippines, Diliman",
                  "Asian Institute of Management"),
        lat = c(14.739091, 14.786772, 14.656445, 14.552463),
        lng = c(120.959290, 120.931546, 121.069666, 121.018764),
