The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). The points were plotted with the following attributes:

- x-axis: Gross Horsepower
- y-axis: Weight per 1000 lbs
- z-axis: Miles per US Gallon
- color: Number of cylinders


```{r cars, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)  ## define %>%

plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~hp, y = ~wt, z = ~mpg, color = ~as.factor(cyl), type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers") %>%
layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Gross Horsepower'),
        yaxis = list(title = 'Weight per 1000 lbs'),
        zaxis = list(title = 'Miles/US Gallon')))
```
